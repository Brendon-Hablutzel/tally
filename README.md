# Tally

A simple dashboard for visualizing and summarizing personal NC State dining plan usage

## Usage

Navigate to (CBORD GET)[https://get.cbord.com/ncsu/full/funds_home.php] and log in. Then, go to the full transaction history table by clicking "View All Transaction History" under the "My Recent Transactions" header. Select the entire transaction history table (either with or without the header will work), copy it, and then paste it into the text box in this application.

NOTE: the table from CBORD GET only includes the last 6 months of transactions, so summary data for plans with transactions more than 6 months ago may not be entirely accurate.
